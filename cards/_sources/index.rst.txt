SymPy |version| Documentation
-----------------------------

`SymPy <https://sympy.org>`_ is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It
aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the
code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily
extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.

If you are new to SymPy, start with the :ref:`introductory tutorial
<intro-tutorial>`.

A `PDF version of these docs <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases>`_ is also available.
